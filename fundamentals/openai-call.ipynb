       "### Why Use `yield`? The Big Advantages\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Memory Efficiency (The #1 Reason):**\n",
       "    *   When dealing with very large datasets, or even infinite sequences, `yield` is a lifesaver.\n",
       "    *   Instead of building a huge list in memory (which could crash your program), a generator `yield`s one item at a time. It only holds one item (or a small batch) in memory at any given moment.\n",
       "    *   This is often called **lazy evaluation** or **on-demand processing**.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *Example:* Generating squares of numbers up to a billion.\n",
       "    ```python\n",
       "    # Bad idea for large N (creates a giant list in memory)\n",
       "    # squares_list = [x*x for x in range(1_000_000_000)]\n",
       "\n",
       "    # Good idea (generates one square at a time)\n",
       "    def generate_squares(n):\n",
       "        for x in range(n):\n",
       "            yield x * x\n",
       "\n",
       "    squares_generator = generate_squares(1_000_000_000) # This doesn't create 1B squares yet!\n",
       "    # Now you can iterate over it, getting squares one by one\n",
       "    # for sq in squares_generator:\n",
       "    #     print(sq) # Will print squares without holding all 1 billion in RAM\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Performance:**\n",
       "    *   Related to memory, if you only need the first few items of a very long sequence, using `yield` means you don't waste time computing the rest.\n",
       "    *   The computation happens only when requested.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Handling Infinite Sequences:**\n",
       "    *   You can easily create functions that generate an infinite stream of data (like Fibonacci numbers, or random numbers) because you never need to store the entire sequence.\n",
       "\n",
       "    ```python\n",
       "    def fibonacci_numbers():\n",
       "        a, b = 0, 1\n",
       "        while True: # This loop would run forever if not for yield!\n",
       "            yield a\n",
       "            a, b = b, a + b\n",
       "\n",
       "    fib_gen = fibonacci_numbers()\n",
       "    print(next(fib_gen)) # 0\n",
       "    print(next(fib_gen)) # 1\n",
       "    print(next(fib_gen)) # 1\n",
       "    print(next(fib_gen)) # 2\n",
       "    print(next(fib_gen)) # 3\n",
       "    # ... and so on, forever if you keep calling next()\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Cleaner Code (compared to creating a full iterator class):**\n",
       "    *   Without `yield`, to create an object that can be iterated over lazily, you'd typically need to write a class with `__iter__` and `__next__` methods. `yield` provides a much more concise way to achieve the same result.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### When to Use `yield`\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Reading large files line by line:** Instead of loading the entire file into memory.\n",
       "*   **Processing data streams:** Live data from a sensor, network, etc.\n",
       "*   **Generating custom sequences:** Number sequences, combinations, permutations.\n",
       "*   **Implementing custom iterators:** When you need a custom way to step through items.\n",
       "*   **Creating \"pipelines\" of data processing:** Chaining multiple generator functions together.\n",

       "\n",
       "### Advanced `yield` (Briefly)\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **`yield from`**: This allows a generator to delegate part of its operation to another generator. Useful for composing generators.\n",
       "*   **`send()` / `throw()` / `close()`**: Generators can actually receive values back from the caller (via `send()`), have exceptions injected into them (`throw()`), or be shut down (`close()`). This enables more complex \"coroutine\" patterns, allowing two-way communication. This is common in asynchronous programming frameworks like `asyncio`.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### In Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "`yield` transforms a function into a **generator**, enabling it to produce a sequence of values **on demand** rather than all at once. This is immensely beneficial for:\n",

       "The `yield` keyword! It's one of my favorite Python concepts. \n",
       "\n",
       "In Python, `yield` is used to define generators. A generator is a type of iterator that can be paused and resumed at specific points.\n",
       "\n",
       "**What does \"paused and resumed\" mean?**\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine you're playing a video game on your phone. The game has multiple levels, and each level takes some time to complete. If the game was written in the classical way (without `yield`), it would load the entire game into memory before starting to play.\n",
       "\n",
       "But with `yield`, it's different. When it encounters a specific point, like `yield`, the execution of the function is suspended, and all the data until that point is stored as an internal state. Then, when you call `next()` on the generator object, the function resumes from where it left off!\n",
       "\n",
       "**How does this help?**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Memory efficiency**: When working with large datasets, using a classical approach (with lists or arrays) would consume all memory, leading to crashes, especially when dealing with huge data.\n",
       "2. **Lazy evaluation**: With generators, only the needed data is created and fetched when requested by `next()`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example Time!**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's an example generator function that demonstrates how it works:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def infinite_sequence():\n",
       "    n = 0\n",
       "    while True:\n",
       "        yield n\n",
       "        n += 1\n",
       "\n",
       "seq_gen = infinite_sequence()\n",
       "\n",
       "# Print the first 5 numbers in the sequence\n",
       "for _ in range(5):\n",
       "    print(next(seq_gen))  # Prints: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
       "\n",
       "print(\"Next few numbers:\")\n",
       "for _ in range(10):  # Continues from where we left off\n",
       "    print(next(seq_gen))\n",
       "```\n",
       "Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. `infinite_sequence` function begins executing.\n",
       "2. It has a while loop that will keep running, generating an infinite sequence of numbers.\n",
       "3. Inside the loop, it encounters the `yield n`, which creates the generator object (`seq_gen`) and assigns its current value (`0`) to it.\n",
       "4. We call `next(seq_gen)`, retrieving the next value from the generator, and print the result (`0`).\n",
       "5. The generator function pauses here until we continue with another `next()` call.\n",
       "\n",
       "When you call `next(seq_gen)` repeatedly, the generator resumes execution only up to the last encountered `yield`. This process creates an illusion that the entire infinite sequence of numbers is being created on demand!\n",
       "\n",
       "This illustrates how `yield` helps Python execute functions \"lazily\" and efficiently manage memory usage when working with large data structures."
